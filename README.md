# nil-theme
Magetno 2 custom theme.

Nil theme is based on Magento Blank theme. This project is my first attempt to create custom theme in Magento 2 so I was trying to make it as simple as I could. Sometimes I changed some PHP to achive my goals. I tested it only on Magento 2 sample data. Checking mini cart and checkout was not possible because of bug in my local environment (fixed in Second-theme).

## Biggest changes

- Changed general look of theme using less variables,  
- Added sliders (main slider and Catalog Widget) using Tiny Slider,
- In layered navigation I use my own js script instead PHP script from Luma theme,
- Changed look of products preview in catalog pages,
- In Product page I moved Details and More information below product info and made them unfoldable,
- Changed reviews section in product page,
- Added js script checking if product has any reviews, if not, displaying message.
